# Today's topic: The queueing model 

## goal: understand the timing performance in  a data communication sytem
### what means timing performance ?
* user experience 
* interactive 
* responsiveness
* undelay

### The queueing model 
* first in first serve

Nic = network interface card =  Data link layer + physical layer 

### end to end latency delay  
1. processing delay ---> form the begining when it meet the Nic
2. queueing delay --->  data queue
3. transmission delay ---> queueing data transmite 
4. propagation delay ---> Nic to Nic (the least delay) 

## little's low 弄熟
